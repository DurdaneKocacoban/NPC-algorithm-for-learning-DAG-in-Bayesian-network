# NPC-algorithm-for-learning-DAG-in-Bayesian-network
#### NPC algorithm is designed for learning Bayesian network formed as DAG in 2001, by Steck

#### This implementation is based on paper[1], details can be seen in this PhD thesis.

#### Start with "ControlCentor.m", there is a simple example with explanation of how to use the code here.

#### If there is any question. please let me know , i will answer you as soon as possible.
